          <h2>What are you guys trying to achive?</h2>
          <p>We are trying to help community independent. And all of know that it can only be achieved through education. It doesn't mean
            that we are going to teach them whatever we want. We are going to give them tools to learn and we will teach them skills needed to
            use those tools.
