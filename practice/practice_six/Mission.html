          <h2>What are you guys trying to achive?</h2>
          <p>We are trying to help community independent. And all of know that it can only be achieved through education. It doesn't mean
            that we are going to teach them whatever we want. We are going to give them tools to learn and we will teach them skills needed to
            use those tools.

      <h2>Where do you guys see yourself as an organization or as a team in next 5 or 10 years?</h2>
      <p>We do not think about ourself, we think about getting the world better, with nutious food, clear
        water and individuals, specially youths building things with computers, building space ships, and those
        stuff you read in sci fi books. Specially those beautiful countries that people label as third world country,
        kids do have plenty of free time there. So, they will build lot of incredible things on their free time. 
        Keep your eyes open.
