          <h2>Making world better place....</h2>
          <p>The urgency to make education started long time ago from youths like you, me and us. It 
            was just a matter of tool or the paltform that we needed to make it happen. Now, in 2019 we
            realized this is a great time. With four peosonal laptop and a single solar panel we moved to South Sudan.

        <h2>How did we got started?</h2>
        <p> With four personal laptop, one solar panel and four souls. We started spreading words about youths intersted in learning
          art, science and coding. We got response from 10000 youth. We were blown out. Fortunately, we decided to train those youths
          who have a little bit of exerience. We planned to make those youth ambasador of out mission. We are training them so that 
          they can go to other parts of their community and start speading knowledge.

        <h1>What do you guys want?</h1>
        <p>The first thing that we want is to end poverty. Teach them agriculture and programming at the same time. Yes, it might take
          a bit longer for the people to understand programming cause English is not their mother tongue. But hey let me tell you that 
          if there's no food to eat and no water to drink, people will do whatever it takes to make food on the table.
